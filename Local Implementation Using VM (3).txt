Local Implementation Using VM Software

 Install Virtualization Software:
 1. Download and install virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware
 Workstation Player.
 Enable Virtualization in BIOS:
 1. Restart your system and access the BIOS/UEFI firmware.
 2. Enable Intel VT-x (for Intel processors) or AMD-V (for AMD processors).
 Download an OS Image:
 1. Obtain an ISO image of the desired OS (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, or Windows).
 2. For Linux: Download from Ubuntu
 or CentOS.
 3. For Windows: Obtain from Microsoft.

 Create a Virtual Machine:
 1. Open VirtualBox/VMware.
 2. Click New and configure:
 1. Name: e.g., "Para-VM".
 2. OSType: Linux/Windows.
 3. RAM:Allocate at least 2 GB.
 4. Storage: Create a virtual hard disk (e.g., 20 GB dynamically
 allocated).

 Attach the ISO Image:
 1. In VMsettings, go to the Storage tab.
 2. Attach the ISO image as the optical drive.
 Start the Virtual Machine:
 1. Boot the VM and follow the installation instructions of the OS.
 Install Para-Virtualization Tools (optional):
 1. Install drivers like VirtIO for better integration and performance (especially if
 using KVM).

Steps to Perform on GCP
 Log in to Google Cloud:
 1. Goto the Google Cloud Console.
 2. Log in with your Google account.

 Create a Virtual Machine:
 1. Navigate to Compute Engine > VM Instances.
 2. Click Create Instance.

 Configure the VM:
 1. Name: e.g., "Para-VM".
 2. Machine Type: Choose e2-micro for free tier or larger as needed.
 3. Boot Disk: Select the desired OS image (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu).
 4. Advanced Options: Check the CPU Platform to ensure compatibility with
 para-virtualization.

 Firewall and Networking:
 1. Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic if needed.
 Create and Start the Instance:
 1. Click Create to start the VM.
 2. Oncedeployed, use the SSH button in the GCP console to connect.
 Steps to Perform on AWS

Log in to AWS:
 1. Goto the AWSManagement Console
 .
 2. Log in with your credentials.
 Launch an EC2 Instance:
 1. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
 2. Click Launch Instance.

 Select AMI:
 1. Choose an AMI with para-virtualization support (e.g., Amazon Linux 2,
 Ubuntu).
 Select Instance Type:
 1. Choose a t2.micro (free tier eligible) or larger instance based on your
 requirements.
 Configure Instance Details:
 1. In the Advanced Details section, verify the virtualization type (should be set
 to paravirtual if applicable).
 2. Configure network, storage, and security settings.
 Launch the Instance:
 1. Review the settings and click Launch.
 2. Usean existing key pair or create a new one for SSH access
